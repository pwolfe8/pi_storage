This was the serial relay for 4180 proj: controlling a version of a roomba using mbed as serial relay, then raspberry pi 2 w/ wifi dongle, then receive on laptop (running a vs studio gui interpretting an xbox controller's commands).

Essentially used the raspberry pi to stream video and command/get info from robot using mbed as a serial relay. Also made a vscode gui and used xbox to control the remote wifi robot.
